# Getting Involved
If you think you might be interested in contrinbuting to Onboarding,
review the following materials
- the rest of this document
- [Facilitating Advice](https://github.com/pivotal/cf-onboarding/blob/master/FACILITATING.md)
- [Prep Checklist](https://github.com/pivotal/cf-onboarding/blob/master/PREP_CHECKLIST.md)

Then open an issue with the title "Onboard <My Name> As a Facilitator" and the checklist at the bottom of this document.

# Onboarding Week Time Requirements

You should expect to spend 10-15 hours facilitating an Onboarding week.

- ~2 hours the week before to schedule meetings, set up Trackers, set up GCP projects, and set up workstations
- ~1 hour the week after to clean out GCP projects and process any action items
- 1 hour intro meeting on Monday
- 1 hour retro Friday
- Up to an hour per day for standup, afternoon check in, and answering miscellaneous questions
- ~1 hour to find presenters for and schedule special topic sessions

You may also attend some or all of the special topic sessions, which could take up to 4 hours.

You will have a pair
and in theory you can split some of this work up,
but in past onboarding weeks the senior facilitator has gotten sick,
had a personal emergency,
gotten assigned to a special project,
or been kept awake all night by dogs,
be ready to run onboarding week mostly on your own.

If you're a new anchor
a new manager,
or doing something else new and time-intensive,
you probably shouldn't try to facilitate onboarding week.

# Other Responsibilities
We have a 1 hour facilitator planning meeting every other week on Thursday afternoons,
one to discuss every upcoming onboarding week,
and one to discuss the just completed onboarding week.
We'll review and assign issues
and integrate feedback from each cohort's retro.

You don't need to attend every or any of these meetings,
and what we need the most help with is facilitating the onboarding weeks themselves,
but we do need to do at least a bit of work every month
to fix bugs and keep the stories up to date.
If you don't have time to run an onboarding week yourself,
you can still help out a lot by handling a few issues.

# Required Skills
You should [review the stories in the OSS track](https://github.com/pivotal/cf-onboarding/blob/master/generate-tracker-csv.go#L35)
and be comfortable deploying Cloud Foundry with BOSH,
and debugging failed deployments.
You don't need to know the answer to every question an onboarding participant might have!
It's more important that you be able to model
how an experienced Pivot solves problems they haven't encountered before.

It's totally fine if you can't solve most of the problems they encounter by yourself
as long as you know who to ask
or where to find documentation.
